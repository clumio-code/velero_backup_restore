> [!NOTE]
> ZIP file clumio_eks_ebs_restore_sa.zip contains all of the code for the lambda functions and the step function.  This zip file must be uploaded
>  to a S3 bucket where it can be accessed by the CFT template when you deploy the solution

> [!NOTE]
> Python files are includes in this github repository for information purposes only.
> This python code reprsents the contents of the lambda functions used by the state machine.
> This code along with non-default python packages are bundled in the ZIP file that is required to run the CFT.

> [!NOTE]
> JSON file example_step_function_inputs.json is an example of the inputs required to run the step function
> These inputs would be modified to reflect your environment


> [!NOTE]
> An IAM role that has permissions to execute the step function and the lambda fucntions (and to write to CloudWatch for logging purposes) must be identified/created before
> you deploy the CFT template.  If required, you can modify the permission of this IAM role after all of the resources have been created to scope those permissions
> to achieve least privledge.

> [!NOTE]
> YAML file clumio-eks-ebs-restore-deploy-cft-sa.yaml is the CloudFormation (CFT) deployment template.  Deploy this CFT template to setup the solution

> [!TIP]
> - [ ] A Clumio backup of each of the EBS resources in the Velero backup file must exist for the automation to complete successfully. 
> - [ ] Identify a S3 bucket where zip file can be copied.
> - [ ] Identify an IAM Role that has the capability to run both the lambda functions and the state machine
> - [ ] Copy ZIP file from the git repository to the S3 bucket
> - [ ] Run the CFT YAML file.  You will need to enter the S3 bucket and IAM role as parameters to run the CFT YAML file
> - [ ] Create an input JSON file for the state machine based upon the example JSON and the descriptions below
> - [ ] Execute the State machine and pass it your input JSON.
> - [ ] Snapshots for all of the EBS resources identified in the backup file are created in the targe location.
> - [ ] Last step of automation updates the Velero backup file (URI) with new snapshot ids
